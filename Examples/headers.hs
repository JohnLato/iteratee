-- HTTP chunk decoding
-- Each chunk has the following format:
--
--        <chunk-size> CRLF <chunk-data> CRLF
--
-- where <chunk-size> is the hexadecimal number; <chunk-data> is a
-- sequence of <chunk-size> bytes.
-- The last chunk (so-called EOF chunk) has the format
-- 0 CRLF CRLF (where 0 is an ASCII zero, a character with the decimal code 48).
-- For more detail, see "Chunked Transfer Coding", Sec 3.6.1 of
-- the HTTP/1.1 standard:
-- http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.6.1

-- The following enum_chunk_decoded has the signature of the enumerator
-- of the nested (encapsulated and chunk-encoded) stream. It receives
-- an iteratee for the embedded stream and returns the iteratee for
-- the base, embedding stream. Thus what is an enumerator and what
-- is an iteratee may be a matter of perspective.

-- We have a decision to make: Suppose an iteratee has finished (either because
-- it obtained all needed data or encountered an error that makes further
-- processing meaningless). While skipping the rest of the stream/the trailer,
-- we encountered a framing error (e.g., missing CRLF after chunk data).
-- What do we do? We chose to disregard the latter problem.
-- Rationale: when the iteratee has finished, we are in the process
-- of skipping up to the EOF (draining the source).
-- Disregarding the errors seems OK then.
-- Also, the iteratee may have found an error and decided to abort further
-- processing. Flushing the remainder of the input is reasonable then.
-- One can make a different choice...
-- Upon further consideration, I reversed the earlier decision:
-- if we detected a framing error, we can't trust the rest of the stream
-- We can't skip till the EOF chunk as we aren't even sure we can
-- recognize the EOF chunk any more.
-- So, we just report the _recoverable_ error upstream:
-- the recovery will be to report the accumlated nested iteratee.
