iteratee
========

This library implements enumerator/iteratee style I/O, as described at
[http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/Iteratee/]

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
==========================

This library uses the Hackage/Cabal build system.  You will need a working
Haskell compiler and appropriate build system.  This is most easily met
by installing the Haskell Platform.  The following command will install
the library:

    cabal install iteratee

This library is pure Haskell, and should install on any system with a suitable
Haskell compiler with no extra steps required.  In particular, POSIX-compatible,
Mac OSX, and Windows should all be supported.

INSTALLATION OPTIONS:
=====================

This library supports the following cabal flags:

  * `splitBase` (default enabled): use the split-up base package.
  * `buildTests` (default disabled): build a test executable.

NOTES:
======

  * The `Data.Iteratee.IO.Posix` module is only available on Posix systems.
  * The `Data.Iteratee.IO.Windows` module is currently a stub.  Currently only the
standard Handle interface is available on Windows.
